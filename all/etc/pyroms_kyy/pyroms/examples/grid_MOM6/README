These scripts came from Mehmet Ilicak who says the conversion script came from Alistair Adcroft.

When running this on my pan-Arctic grid, I got:

convert_ROMS_grid_to_MOM6.py:230: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in true_divide
  mom6_grid['supergrid']['angle'][:,1:-1] = numpy.arctan( (lat[:,2:] - lat[:,:-2]) / ((lon[:,2:] - lon[:,:-2]) * cos_lat[:,1:-1]) )

It seemed to work anyway.
