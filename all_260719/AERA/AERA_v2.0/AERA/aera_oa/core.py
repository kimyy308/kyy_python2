"""
Core functions of the AERA algorithm.

Contains the following functions:

- runmean : Calculate a running mean of any timeseries using a window
    length (winlen).
- extrapolated_runmean : Extrapolate a running mean at the beginning and end of the 
    time series.
- extrapolated_runmean_anth_arag : Calculate the extrapolated running
    mean of the observed/simulated aragonite saturation state. Calls the functions
    extrapolated_runmean and runmean.
- calculate_relative_target_aragonite : Calculate the relative target
    for aragonite saturation state [-].
- _calculate_previous_emission_slope : Calculate the slope at year X by using the emission
    curve from the previous stocktake.
- calculate_remaining_emission_budget : Calculate the remaining
    emission budget (REB). The REB is the amount of CO2-fe emission that
    are still allowed to be emitted in the future.
- get_adaptive_emissions : MAIN FUNCTION. Calculate "optimal"
    near-future CO2 emissions.
